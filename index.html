                        <p>Hello there! I am a Grade 12 student in the Arts & Design track of De la Salle Santiago Zobel. My art style is like a patchwork quilt; it puts together different elements (e.g. collage)  all into one piece. Passionate about the intersection of the arts and technology, I work tirelessly to create for my numerous advocacies, such as mental health and feminism. In the future, I aspire to become a UX/UI designer, hoping to make the arts accessible to all.</p>

                        <p>INSIGHTS ABOUT PROFESSION</p>
                        <p>What I learned from this interview is not technical knowledge like coding, but the significance people can have on your product. As an introvert, my preconception of the profession was that it was just a one-man job; all you needed was experience and a laptop. However, it turns out that communication is a vital skill in the entire process of product development. For instance, in the beginning, user research must be done in order to design the product’s experience to the client’s needs. This is done through surveys, tests, etc. When the product has finished development, it doesn’t mean that your job is done: multiple revisions will be coming your way. How can you develop a usable product when you’re not able to interact with the users themselves?</p>
                        <p>This is why clarity is so vital; being vague will not help you earn in a world where people have specific needs. For instance, filling an app with tons of features just to satisfy a larger target audience will only make users confused. This also applies to code. In order to collaborate better with fellow designers and developers, your code must follow naming conventions in order to make it easier to read. This indicates how design must fit to a set of standards despite needing to be visually appealing. So no matter how pretty it is, a creation cannot be a product if it’s unusable. This is what differentiates art and design; the latter has a need for function. </p>
                        <p>I realized how useful a design thinking mindset can be not just for work, but for other aspects of life. For instance, empathizing is the first stage of the process. The goal of this stage is to be able to fully understand the scope of the problem; methods for collecting the relevant data include consultation with experts and immersion in the environment of the problem (Dam & Siang, 2018). Empathizing can also apply to dealing with drama in your relationships. In order not to make a biased judgement, one must hear all the sides of the story by asking the people who are involved and trying to imagine yourself in their shoes.</p>
                        <p>With all this knowledge, I will definitely make an effort in interacting more with everyone involved in the user experience industry: students and teachers alike. These connections can hold useful information (such as experience with clients) that you cannot find in typical classrooms, and can also serve as potential collaborators for future projects. No man is an island, so how can an unknown designer become successful? Knowing this, I want to overcome my anxieties so I will be able to improve my craft. Hopefully, by making connections, I can leave a mark on the world.</p>
                        <p>ABOUT THE PROJECT</p>
                        <p>For the subject Apprenticeship and Exploration in Art Production, we were tasked to create an artwork related to our chosen profession. Due to my combined love of art, design, and technology, I decided to choose the field of digital product design. Because of this, the output I decided to make was a website coded from scratch.</p>
                        <p>Unlike in art, where outputs can be created just for aesthetics, products must be designed in order to solve a certain problem. With thought, I was able to find the problem I wanted to solve in one of my passions: dance. As someone who always aspires to become better, I was struggling to practice on my own without a teacher. This lack of knowledge was made pronounced when I overexerted both of my hip flexors in the span of a few months (separate times). If I had known my limits, I could have avoided this injury. </p>
                        <p>Because of this, I realized that there was a need for a tool to help dancers with body awareness. As a result, I conceptualized a website as a solution to this. This project of mine is named “The Dance Diagnosis”, and it is a website that helps contemporary dancers (e.g. ballet, jazz, modern) assess their weaknesses; they will then be given recommendations for fixing them.</p>
                        <p>I decided to challenge myself by making the website a quiz, which I have never coded before. I thought I would be fine, having planned everything in advance (from framework to design). However, I underestimated the amount of effort it would take to build my initial design. The quiz was supposed to have logic branching, where the questions you get are tailored to your answers; for instance, if you said you preferred dogs over cats in question one, then the succeeding questions would only involve dogs. Even if it was a great idea, it was too complex for my current skill level. As a result, I had to change the model entirely. </p>
                        <p>After searching for ideas, the one I chose to emulate was a Buzzfeed checklist quiz. This may have been more restricted, but it was also easier to code. Along with the format, I also had to change the information involved. The results of the quiz were supposed to be body weaknesses (e.g. your core is weak), but there were too much to cover. Searching again, I found the components of physical fitness easier to handle. These included muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance and flexibility. I decided to exclude body fat composition from the components because I felt like it was too different from the others.</p>
                        <p>When I finished the website, my work wasn’t over yet. From what I learned from my professional, I still had to test it with other people in order to validate the user interface. For this purpose, I chose my classmates from ballet. I made an evaluation in Google Forms asking the user to grade the website’s content, interface, etc; you may find the results of the survey in this link: <a href='http://bit.ly/DDEvaluationResults'>http://bit.ly/DDEvaluationResults</a>. The users unanimously agreed about it being both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. However, they were divided regarding the need for more content (e.g. recommendations), with some being content with what was provided while others asked for more. There were also complaints regarding accessibility. For instance, one said that the text was hard to read because of the background. Another also said that there were issues with the user interface on a mobile device. Overall, they all found the website’s concept cool, believing it would be useful for dancers.</p>
                        <p>In this project, I realized the value of prototyping. In a user design workshop I attended before, the instructor emphasized the importance of low-fidelity prototyping, which is when sketches of the product are done with pencil and paper. What I learned can be summed up in one statement: “Fall in love with the problem, not the solution”. There should be multiple sketches done in order to be able to choose the most appropriate design. If one sticks to polishing only one design, making the necessary changes will be harder. I learned this the hard way when I thought the initial design I made was good enough already. In the end, I wasted time on researching how to implement a difficult design and had to redo everything.</p>
                        <p>This can also be applied to real life; one example would be advising friends. You may already have a go-to approach, whether it’s simply listening or using humour. However, different problems and personalities call for different solutions. For instance, joking may not always help someone who wants to be serious. In this case, simply listening would be the better option. The main lesson to learn from product design is empathy. Unlike in art, where people create for aesthetic purposes, design must have both form and functionality. As a result, the designer must center his/her thinking around the user. After all, there’s no point in designing a product if no one is going to use it. Overall, I am grateful for having the opportunity to pursue my passion for a project; the lessons I learned from the experience will definitely stay with me for a long time.</p>

                                    <h2>Arts & Design = suffering; at least there's support</h2>
                                    <p>Posted on August 18, 2017</p>
                                    <p>No words can describe how blessed I am to be in Arts and Design. Not everyone gets to pursue his/her passion due to circumstances; I appreciate having a family who supports my talent. However, the world is not so nice. No matter how skilled you are at your craft, there will always be problems, whether they come in the form of malicious customers or judgmental critics.</p>
                                    <p>This is why I am thankful to have experienced “The Artist Is In: Conversations with Emerging Artists in the Philippines”, which was a talk with Armi Millare (singer), Anjo Bolarda (visual artist), and Ral Arrogante (sculptor). My first impressions of them were of respect; then, the people right before my eyes were seasoned professionals. Maybe they would be strict? Would they smile at all? I was anxious to find out.</p>
                                    <p>However, they turned out to be easygoing. No bad vibes could be sensed in their presence. When they spoke, no jargon was used; everyone could understand them. In the end, instead of being shy, I did not hesitate to ask questions. That is how approachable they were.</p>
                                    <p>Each art discussed the aspects of his/her own industry in his/her own way. Armi Millare talked about being a performing artist: the responsibilities of each member in her band (“Up Dharma Down”), which go beyond playing instruments (e.g. marketing, public relations, etc.) Meanwhile, Anjo Bolarda discussed his personal projects, going beyond what he’s known for (painting/illustration) to talk about what he’s done in the field of performance art; I love how we went into detail, describing the story behind the product. Ral Arrogante also showed his creation as a sculptor, talking about his process: sourcing materials, putting them together (which can take at least a day), etc.</p>
                                    <p>All of their words filled me with inspiration; they were motivating, making me believe that despite the stigma, artists still have a chance in the future. It is rare to get insight into professions that are normally discouraged due to uncertain financial support; after all, there are many cases of parents who dissuade their children from going into artistic fields. Now, at least I have an idea of what to do. I can apply these new learnings to my outlook in life: being persistent. If you really love what you do in life, money or fame will not be a motivation. Arts and Design may be a difficult strand, but the passion for creation makes it all so worth it. Thank you miss.</p>

                                    <h1>An Artist Underappreciated</h1>
                                    <h2>Pacita Abad has accomplished so much; is this all she gets?</h2>
                                    <p>Posted on August 14, 2017</p>
                                    <p>To the world, she is an internationally renowned artist. To herself, she is just a gypsy. Pacita Abad’s achievements have all come from a desire to “paint the globe”, working in more than 80 countries as a a result. In a world where the great artists are mostly white men (Jones, 2015), having a woman of color (her race also another disruption) come to be globally recognized as one is a rare phenomenon – one the Philippines can be proud of.</p>
                                    <h3>The Beginning: A Blank Slate </h3>
                                    <p>Considering the immense talent she had, it is surprising to find out she started painting late; in her mid-20s, she sacrificed a lot (having declined a scholarship for law) just to pursue her passion. As a result, she was a blank slate. While her other classmates were drawing portraits and landscapes, she was just beginning to learn the basics of drawing, composition, and perspective. However, she reigned in one element: color.</p>
                                    <p>Her art style is similar to the nature of children’s drawings: colorful, abstract, and experimental. Color would be the only thing constant in her work; aside from that, her canvas was constantly changing. She described her style herself: "I always see the world through color, although my vision, perspective and paintings are constantly influenced by new ideas and changing environments."</p>
                                    <h3>Reflection on Expression</h3>
                                    <p>I can relate to her need for something new. As one with a miniscule attention span, I cannot be interested in one thing for a long time. In my art, I am constantly jumping from one sketch to another; this lack of satisfaction could be called experimentation, like what you would find in Pacita Abad’s work.</p>
                                    <h3>The Continuation: Extroverted Exploration</h3>
                                    <p>When she finished school, the next place where she painted was her studio in Bangdalesh. However, she realized there was more action outside; the action in the streets would inspire her to come up with portraits, bazaars, and landscapes. Craving more, she continued this routine as she travelled this world, visiting countries like Sudan, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Yemen, the Dominican Republic, and of course, the Philippines.</p>
                                    <p>The people around her became her muses. In fact, as a woman of compassion, many of her paintings were sociopolitical, the subjects ranging from Cambodian refugees to Ninoy Aquino himself (technically his corpse). Not only did she bring attention to people’s woes; she even sought to help them. For instance, she became an immigration lawyer, with one reason being the plight of OFWs. She was also generous, giving art workshops to tons of kids around the globe. She believed art was for everyone; if a woman who started learning in her 20s end up having numerous exhibitions in different countries, imagine what a kid can do!</p>
                                    <h3>Reflection on Aspiration</h3>
                                    <p>As an arts and design student, Pacita Abad’s development as an artist is inspiring; she went from zero to (literally a) hero. It gives me hope that no matter how bad you are at something, you can master it. I also admire her humility. Despite all the accolades she achieved, her most treasured one was the happiness of her audience. According to her, she felt like an ambassador of colors, always projecting a positive mood that helps make the world smile. Maybe one day, my art will benefit others and not just me. What helped Pacita achieve these was passion; hopefully, I can find it in myself.</p>
                                    <h3>The Conclusion: A Lack of Appreciation</h3>
                                    <p>Despite all that Pacita Abad accomplished, why is she still not a National Artist? She fills all the criteria: being a Filipino citizen, having built a sense of nationhood with her paintings (especially the ones on the Marcos regime), having pioneered a new art style (“trapunto”), and being bestowed numerous awards, both local and international. What holds her back from receiving the title?</p>
                                    <p>I believe she still lacks this because of her gender – an example of the male dominance in the fine arts industry. Even if she’s already won an award meant for men only (“Ten Outstanding Young Men”) , it is hard to break such a barrier twice. When checking the list of National Artists for Visual Arts, one can see that all of the awardees are male. This is not only seen in the Philippines; of all the work in major permanent collections worldwide, only an estimated 5% is made by female artists (Cochrane, 2013).</p>
                                    <p>A certain type should not hog the spotlight; it is now time for it to shine on the world’s minorities. This especially applies to this country. Like what Pacita Abad said: “It is long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines is full of outstanding women”. Even the amazing people can be underappreciated. Everyone, please open your eyes to them.</p>

                                    <h1>The Inspiration of Injustice</h1>
                                    <h2>A.K.A. "Heneral Luna" makes me want to fight everyone, including myself. Wake up, people!</h2>
                                    <p>Posted on July 9, 2017</p>
                                    <p>Heneral Luna deserved better; not just the character Antonio Luna himself, but also the movie, a nationalistic masterpiece. In a society where shallow content sells, from showbiz love teams to multi-entry installments milking a celebrity, Heneral Luna was a breath of fresh air. After watching this, I was filled with a mix of emotions; there was awe, pride, and anger. The ending especially was the most infuriating; every Filipino would’ve wished for justice. This wouldn’t have happened without the movie’s inspiration, the titular protagonist himself.</p>
                                    <h3>Heneral Artikulo Uno</h3>
                                    <p>If there was one word to describe Antonio Luna, it would be “intense”. His allies would say he was what kept the army fighting together. For instance, he charged with his horse to attack the Americans, encouraging his fellow comrades to also run into the battlefield. His guts surprised the Americans, to the point that they considered him their main threat. Meanwhile, his enemies (mostly fellow Filipinos) complained that he was volatile; for instance, he was known by other soldiers as “Heneral Articulo Uno” for constantly using the titled rule to get his way: “All who refuse to follow the general’s orders must be executed without a benefit of trial in court”. Either way, anyone could agree that he truly loved his country; everything he did was for the freedom (not the safety) of the Filipinos.</p>
                                    <h3>The Worst Enemies</h3>
                                    <p>However, not all Filipinos felt the same as him. One of his enemies, Buencamino, believed making peace with the Americans would lead to safety for the whole country. However, according to Luna’s beliefs, one thing wouldn’t be safe: the freedom of the Filipinos. “Bayan o sarili?” is the question raised here; according to Luna, the Filipinos’ close ties to their families is their biggest fault. We’d do everything to protect them from danger, but when it comes to protecting our nationhood, there’s a lack of courage. There was also Emilio Aguinaldo, the president at the time. He also aimed for the freedom of the Filipinos; he knew Luna could actually make that possibility true, which made him Aguinaldo’s most valued general. However, it wasn’t enough; he still prioritized his feelings, including his eventual grudge for Luna, which lead to his death. As a result, the Filipinos lost the war. He is the antithesis of the Filipino soldier.</p>
                                    <h3>True Blood</h3>
                                    <p>Another character that struck me was Luna’s lover, Isabel. She’s someone who actually chose to serve her country over herself, even if that meant giving up on her romance with Luna himself. She knew their feelings wouldn’t work in the war (e.g. she told him “You’re married to war, and I’m just your mistress), so she made the logical choice. There was also Joven, the reporter. For me, his importance laid in what he represented: the Filipino youth, the hope of this county. Journalism is a dangerous profession; publishing a controversial truth could cost you your life. Despite that, Joven pursued the truth (for the publication), even going as far as interviewing Antonio Luna. We need more people like Isabel and Joven in this country.</p>
                                    <h3>The Choice</h3>
                                    <p>Considering the dire circumstances in the movie, the best answer for “Bayan o sarili” would be the former. If everyone prioritized their lives in the face of danger, who’d be there to fight for our national identity? So yes, the Filipino is worth dying for. Without a cultural identity, we don’t exist because it’s part of us; it made us into the people we are today. Did Heneral Luna die just for us to suffer from colonial mentality today, despite having the freedom Filipinos fought so long and hard for? I think not.</p>

                                    <h2>Evaristti's "Helena & El Pescador" proves a point, but at what cost?</h2>
                                    <p>Posted on July 5, 2017</p>
                                    <p>Humanity may be the most advanced race on the planet, but does this mean our morals are up to par? This is one of the questions that was brought up when Marco Evaristti revealed his controversial exhibit “Helena & El Pescador”. Instead of a typical painting or sculpture, what he presented were ten blenders with live goldfish inside of them. The visitors had the choice to either press the button of any blender (and in doing so, kill the fish inside) or leave it alone. How was such a moral travesty allowed to be presented in a museum? Is this piece allowed to be considered art?</p>
                                    <p>An artwork is not defined by its amount of detail or "Instagrammable" look. According to the Oxford dictionary, the definition of art is “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination”. So yes, at first sight, the critics are right; there is a lack of aesthetics. After all, it's all just a big show of blenders with fish in them, right? However, if we study further the Value Theory, this exhibit still serves importance to some people due to its use of ethics.</p>
                                    <p>If this exhibit is art, it could be evaluated by certain criteria known as an aesthetic theory. This piece would do well if emotionalism and instrumentalism were applied to it. Emotionalism is all about communicating feelings to the audience, with examples such as social issues. Meanwhile, for Instrumentalism, the message is vital for success, since its goal is to influence society. The exhibit was able to make use of both of these theories since it proved this message: the power of humanity over all other species. This was shown by evoking feelings of anger, guilt etc. in the audience; by giving them the choice to push the button or not, it was demonstrated that anyone is capable of killing no matter what good they can do.</p>
                                    <p>Despite its cruelty, the exhibit is an example of human creativity; it’s a feat to be able to send an important message with such unconventional materials (i.e. blender). Therefore, with this definition, it is considered art. However, there's a question that remains unanswered; is endangering innocent lives justified in the name of art? That's left for us, the audience, to answer. Now, reader, where do your morals lie?</p>
